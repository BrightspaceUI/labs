00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.000
So we decided we had to put in a new well

NOTE This is a comment, and should not be displayed

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.500
and somebody asked me why I didn't get it wedged

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.250
and I didn't know what he was talking about so

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.500
he said there was an ol' fella out here that

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.000
wedges wells and he'll get ya

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.750
water every time so I said okay how much does he want

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.750
he wants ten bucks I said bring him on so we brought

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.500
this fella out and he went to work with his pit stick

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.500
I remember now as a pit stick or a well

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
he used both yeah either one one works as good as the other

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.500
and

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
he

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.500
strikes a point where he hits water

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.500
and he puts a stone down

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and he goes down

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.500
and that same line where he hits water again

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
he puts another stone down

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.500
then he goes at right angles with this and gets

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.500
a stone over here and a stone over here and where

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.250
these two lines cross that's the point

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
he said these water veins always run on an angle

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.250
never due north and south or east and west

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.500
they're north-west and south-east
